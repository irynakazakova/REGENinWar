# REGENinWar
Soil restoration after the devastating effects of war is one of the most urgent tasks of modern ecology, agronomy and conscious communities. Some soil disturbances are visible to the naked eye: craters from multiple launch rocket system shelling near Izyum in Kharkiv Oblast have been seen worldwide. Сontamination with heavy metals that can enter the human body is not visible but is a motivating factor influencing the study of soil pollution and cleanup methods. From a strategic perspective, less obvious global impacts of soil degradation should also be considered. Among them are desertification, wind erosion, and reduction of fertility.

WHO WE ARE?

NGO Permaculture in Ukraine engages in research, training, and designing sustainable systems and a farming system that works in harmony with natural processes, with minimal labor costs and without harm to the environment. The Network of Educational and Demonstration Centers helps in this, where all practical actions regarding the search and use of soil and ecosystem restoration technologies occur.

WHAT DO WE WANT?

The Regeneration in War Project aims to support the work of two permaculture centers in the Kyiv region. These centers need help continuing their experimental and educational activities.

1. Permaculture center “Radaria” uses Biochar to restore and improve soil fertility. Biochar, a product of biomass pyrolysis, increases soil organic carbon, retains moisture and nutrients, stabilizes soil, and binds toxicants. The center's research shows that using biochar with warm bed technology significantly boosts productivity and promotes soil recovery. The result has been transforming heavily damaged areas into fertile and productive land.

2. Research farm "Pidkova" at the ecostation "Hlyboki Balyki" applies holistic planned pasture management for soil restoration and biodiversity. Founder Bohdan Popov aims to implement and disseminate Holistic Management methods in Ukraine. The project focuses on creating an ecosystem service farm. Goat grazing has been reintroduced, resulting in positive outcomes such as reduced invasive trees and improved pasture management planning with geoinformation software.

Both centers conduct regular training, inviting people to learn, volunteer, and rehabilitate.

WHAT WE BELIEVE IN?

Our project addresses the urgent need for soil restoration and biodiversity after war-induced devastation, tackling visible disturbances like craters, burnt forests and steppes and invisible like contamination with heavy metals or decrease in fertility.

Our mission is to heal war-torn soil and restore ecosystems through sustainable practices, aligning with global ecological goals and contributing to environmental and social well-being. We also aim to teach as many people as possible how to use these good practices.

OUR STORY

Our organization was founded in 2011 to bring permaculture practices to Ukrainians. We translated books, conducted courses, and organized international conferences. In 2022, together with GEN Ukraine, we launched the Green Road of Ecovillages Project and helped more than 3000 IDPs in Ukraine. Now, we are responding to the urgent need for soil restoration in war-affected areas by creating a network of educational and demonstrational sites based on remediation soil and biodiversity practices.


Unfortunately, the war affects not only the soil but also the material condition of the people, so week-term courses are becoming less and less available even for those interested in it. With your support, we can not only help centers with their experiments but also make disseminating this knowledge more accessible.

Key activities include researching and applying biochar for soil restoration at Radaria and implementing holistic planned pasture management at Pidkova. We conduct regular training sessions and engage the community in our efforts. Evidence of our activities can be seen in transforming damaged lands into fertile areas and the positive outcomes from holistic grazing practices.

Our impact is demonstrated through successfully restoring soil fertility and ecosystem health. We measure our success using the number of courses conducted, participants, and specific restoration work (e.g., biochar application, animal treatment).

The war leaves behind a lot of destruction and harms people and the environment. Permaculture can heal both, and that is exactly what Permaculture in Ukraine is doing.
